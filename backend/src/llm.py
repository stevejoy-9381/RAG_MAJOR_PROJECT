src/llm.py — LLM Configuration and Prompt Template
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
  Sets up the Groq LLM client and defines the prompt template that tells
  the LLM exactly how to behave when answering questions from document chunks.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE?
  Prompt engineering is its own concern. Keeping it separate means:
    - You can swap LLM providers without touching retriever.py
    - You can iterate on the prompt without touching anything else
    - Interviewers see clean architecture when they read your code

CONNECTIONS:
  → Imported by src/retriever.py which passes the LLM and prompt
    into the LangChain RetrievalQA chain.

    Create and return a Groq LLM client.

    WHY GROQ?
      - Free tier: 14,400 requests/day, no credit card for signup
      - Fast: Groq runs on custom LPU hardware → ~500 tokens/second
        (OpenAI GPT-4 is ~50 tokens/second for comparison)
      - Llama3-8B quality: very good for factual Q&A from context

    WHY temperature=0.2?
      Temperature controls randomness:
        0.0 → always picks the most likely next token (fully deterministic)
        1.0 → very creative/random
        0.2 → mostly deterministic with tiny variance
      For a Q&A system grounded in documents, low temperature = factual answers.
      We do NOT want the model being "creative" — we want it to report facts.

    COMMON ERROR:
      AuthenticationError → your GROQ_API_KEY is missing or wrong.
      Fix: check your .env file has the correct key from console.groq.com

    Build and return the prompt template for grounded Q&A.

    WHAT IS A PROMPT TEMPLATE?
      A PromptTemplate is a reusable string with {placeholders}.
      LangChain fills in {context} (retrieved chunks) and {question}
      (user's question) before sending to the LLM.

    WHY THIS SPECIFIC PROMPT DESIGN?

      1. "Use ONLY the context below"
         → Prevents hallucination. The LLM is instructed not to use its
           training data — only what we retrieved from the document.

      2. 'If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't know"'
         → This is critical. Without this line, the LLM invents an answer.
           With it, the system admits uncertainty. Trust > fake confidence.

      3. "Be concise and cite the relevant section if possible."
         → Encourages source grounding in the answer text itself.

      4. "Context:" before the chunks
         → Clear signal to the model about where the document text starts.

    THE {context} PLACEHOLDER:
      LangChain automatically fills this with the 4 retrieved chunks,
      joined together as one string. Each chunk includes its metadata
      (page number, source) so the model can reference them.

    THE {question} PLACEHOLDER:
      Filled with whatever the user typed in the Streamlit text box.

    template = """You are a precise document Q&A assistant.

- Answer directly and concisely.
- Answer in the same language the question was asked in, when possible, even if the source context is in a different language.
- If the answer spans multiple sections, combine them clearly.
- If you reference a specific fact, mention which part of the context it came from.
