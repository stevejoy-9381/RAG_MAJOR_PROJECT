src/auth.py — JWT Authentication
──────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
  Two jobs:
    1. Password hashing  — safely store and verify passwords using bcrypt
    2. JWT management    — create access tokens and verify them on each request

WHY JWT (JSON Web Tokens)?
  HTTP is stateless — the server doesn't "remember" you between requests.
  Two ways to solve this:
    Sessions: server stores a session dict {session_id: user_data}.
              Works but requires server memory, doesn't scale across instances.
    JWT:      server signs a token containing user data and sends it to the client.
              Client sends the token on every request.
              Server verifies the signature — no server-side storage needed.
              Scales horizontally, works with any number of API instances.

  For a portfolio RAG app: JWT is the right choice.

HOW JWT WORKS (simplified):
  Token = base64(header) + "." + base64(payload) + "." + HMAC_signature
  payload = {"sub": user_id, "username": "alice", "exp": 1705416000}
  signature = HMAC_SHA256(header + "." + payload, secret_key)

  Server creates: signs with SECRET_KEY
  Client stores: in session_state (browser memory)
  Client sends: Authorization: Bearer <token>
  Server verifies: checks HMAC signature with SECRET_KEY
                   checks "exp" field hasn't expired
                   extracts user_id from "sub" field

  If SECRET_KEY is kept private, tokens cannot be forged.
  If a token is stolen, it's valid until it expires (hence short expiry = safer).

WHY bcrypt FOR PASSWORDS?
  You must NEVER store plain-text passwords.
  bcrypt is a one-way hash function designed specifically for passwords:
    - Intentionally slow (100ms per hash) → brute-force attacks are impractical
    - Salted automatically → same password hashes differently each time
    - Industry standard since 1999

  SHA256/MD5 are NOT safe for passwords — they're too fast (attackers can
  try billions per second). Use bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2 for passwords.

CONNECTIONS:
  → Used by src/user_store.py for password operations
  → Used by api.py for the auth dependency (get_current_user)

    Hash a plain-text password using bcrypt.

    WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE:
      1. A random salt is generated (16 bytes)
      2. The password is truncated to 72 bytes (bcrypt hard limit)
      3. The password + salt is hashed with bcrypt (intentionally slow: ~100ms)
      4. Returns: "$2b$12$<salt><hash>" — all information needed to verify later

    The same password hashed twice produces DIFFERENT strings because the
    salt is random. This is correct behaviour — it prevents rainbow table attacks.

    NOTE: bcrypt only uses the first 72 bytes of a password. Truncating
    explicitly avoids an error from newer bcrypt versions (5.0+).

    EXAMPLE:
      hash_password("mysecret") → "$2b$12$N9qo8..."
      hash_password("mysecret") → "$2b$12$K3mR1..."   ← different! (different salt)

      1. Extracts the salt from the stored hash
      2. Password is truncated to 72 bytes (same as during hashing)
      3. Hashes plain_password WITH THAT SAME SALT
      4. Compares the result to the stored hash (constant-time comparison)

    Returns True if they match, False otherwise.
    The constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks.

    Create a signed JWT access token.

    WHAT'S IN THE TOKEN:

        {"exp": datetime_24h_from_now}   ← expiry timestamp

    The "sub" (subject) field is the standard JWT claim for user identity.
    We use user_id (UUID) as the subject — not username, because:
      - Usernames can change; UUIDs are permanent
      - UUIDs reveal no personal information if the token is logged
